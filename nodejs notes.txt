Node JS
-------
Node is a runtime environment. It is not a programming language or a framework or a library.
It is used to run javascript programs.
Generally javascript is run on a browser. Each browser a have a different javascript engine to convert the JS language to machine language. like chrome have v8.
node is built on v8 of chrome.
node have different objects apart from document, window, etc

console is a global object.
setTimeout()-used to call a function after some time. this can be used inside client/browser.

these objects are under global object

node file name is used to run the JS (node app.js)

To make an object public assign it to module.exports.<variable name>

require()--used to include/load another module
to declare a variable as final/constant, can use const in place of var. This restricts from overriding a value accidentally

Modular wrapper function--(function (exports, require, module, __filename, __dirname) {

})

by default our js gets wrapped inside a function

we can get information  about network, files, operating system etc which is nto possible with JS

http is used to create a server and listen to the events and post the response to the browser.
In real time we dont create a server but can use express framework to run js in nodejs.
can see the documentation for nodejs on its site
